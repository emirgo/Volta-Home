# What is Smart-Home?
 This device aims to improve your household. By version 3.0 the device will have a colourful LCD display which you can mount on a wall, measure temperature, humidity and air pressure. You will receive alerts to your phone in case of an intruder and quality change in air such as gas leak or fire. All data will be visible on the display and you can view data and data history on a browser of your choice.  You will be able to order the board with the processor soldered on and you can source the necessary parts yourself to solder them or you can order a ready board with all the components on it. You can easily modify and flash new firmware on the board you will receive.
